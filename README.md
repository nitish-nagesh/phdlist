|Prof. Elena Agapie | Informatics| I am actively recruiting students interested in working at the intersection of HCI, Health, and/or Behavior Change! I welcome students with a variety of backgrounds, including: Informatics, Computer Science, Design, Psychology and Health. If you are a prospective PhD student, please apply to the Informatics PhD program. If you are an UCI undergraduate or Master student and want to do independent research with me, send me your CV or portoflio, transcript, and a description of what aspects of my research interest you. To work with me, I recommend having some experience in qualitative or mixed methods, design and prototyping, or programming. Undergraduate students should first take IN4MATX131 or have equivalent experience. | http://eagapie.com|
|Prof. Crista Lopes | Informatics| PhD I am always looking for motivated people who want to pursue a PhD under my guidance. If you are one of them, make sure to apply to the Software Engineering doctoral program in ICS. Note that the Software Engineering program is different, and more focused, than the Computer Science program offered by the School. I typically do not supervise students in the CS program. (If you're not sure about your focus and future advisor, apply to both)| https://ics.uci.edu/~lopes/|
